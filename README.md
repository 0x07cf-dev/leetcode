## Leetcode Solutions - Python
Here are my Leetcode submissions. It's nice to have them all in one place.

I've recently decided that I need some Python in my life. It's simple, straightforward, and gets the job done without much hassle.
It lets me focus on the problem at hand, the substance, rather than on the implementation of the solution, the form.

I mean, aren't programming languages just tools? Some are more robust, others are just quicker to swing.
And one day I just couldn't stop thinking: *why not swing fast*?

I don't really miss you, Java. Delete me from your contact list.
