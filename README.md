## Leetcode Solutions - Python
Here are my Leetcode submissions. It's nice to have them all in one place.

I've recently decided to give Python a shot. It's simple, straightforward, and gets the job done without much hassle.
It lets me focus on the problem at hand, the substance, rather than on the code itself, the form of the solution.

This repo is not just about Leetcode solutions: I will be using it mostly to help me gauge my progress with the language.
As such, I will also be implementing some data structures as a good exercise.
